                    <p>Medicare Advantage, also known as Part C, are Medicare health plans offered by private health companies such as Anthem, Humana, United Healthcare, etc. There are different types of plans available, but each one must provide the same benefits as Original Medicare, and many include prescription drug coverage, as well as additional benefits for dental, vision, and hearing care. These are things that Original Medicare doesnâ€™t cover.</p>
